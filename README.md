# ky1eBot
Version 1.2.1-0-public

A basic discord bot made with discord.js

My first ever discord bot using the discord.js framework.

So far it only has 9 basic commands.
Will update as I develop more commands.

Base bot prefix is "kyle$"

## List of commands
    changePrefix - Changes bot's prefix (per guild).
    restorePrefix - restores bot's prefix back to default "kyle$"
    definition - Get the definition of a word(is limitted to the https://dictionaryapi.dev/ api being used).
    help - Get a full list of all commands/extra info.
    ping - Is used to get bot's responce time.
    randomName - Gives back a random name from a list of 21,000.
    insult - The bot will kindly insult the givin name.
    catch - The bot will take the given message and frame it.
    testWrite - Test right to the mongoDB.

## Issues
- the output of the definition command isnt perfect, need to fix the output of multiple definitions of a word.
